# FrontRoom
FrontRoom is a client side chat room app build from the create-react-app. I have added a mockState.json which shows 
how you can send the data from server side. There is an option to run node app.js in 
the Server directory which will allow you to see a very basic socket.io version of the app running.
However, FrontRoom is designed to look good on desktop inorder for you to focus on the server
side platform.
